# Install Jenkins

This workshop is based on [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/).

In the first part of this workshop we are going to install docker.

https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
and Docker Compose

https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

 
This part of the workshop is based on [this blog post](https://nullsweep.com/creating-a-secure-pipeline-jenkins-with-sonarqube-and-dependencycheck/).

After installing docker, we can bring the whole infrastructure like this:
git clone git@github.com:SvetlomirBalevski/secure-pipeline-example.git
cd secure-pipeline-example/unified_pipeline_example/
docker-compose up
